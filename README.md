# trread

`trread` is a package to read GTFS feeds. Its main purpose was providing a version of [tidytransit](https://github.com/r-transit/tidytransit/) without [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf). However, there were not enough resources to keep trread up to date with tidytransit's development.

CRAN version 0.2.7 is still available but this repo is no longer actively maintained. Please consider using [gtfsio](https://github.com/r-transit/gtfsio/) (no sf dependency) or [tidytransit](https://github.com/r-transit/tidytransit/).
